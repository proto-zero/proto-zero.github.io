            <p>Sean Lenhart also shines in the role of missionary preacher St. John Rivers,
            making this gentle and sweet but gradually possessive man the ultimate anti-Rochester.
            As the St. John Rivers era seems to be the end of the story, his gradual transition
            from savior to emotional manipulator literally made the audience gasp- his specific
            brand of imperialist fervor, combined with his belief that Jane is a gift from God
            to him, makes him only slightly less terrifying a cleric than Brocklehurst.<br>

            <p>Holy crap, those audible reviews don't do you justice at all… Honestly, I wouldn't have been able to listen to (author’s) book if someone else had been reading it. You made the neurotic thoughts seem natural and gave the characters personality.<br>

            <p>The show that hits all the right notes… Behind the scenes,
            stage director and choreographer Sean Lenhart does a capable job

            <p>I recall Lenhart killing it as the Prosecuting Attorney in Parade a while back and
            he did not disappoint this time around. Lenhart has quite a set of pipes on him and they
            were well exercised in songs such as “A Wandr’ing Minstrel I” or Nanki-Poo’s duet with
            his beloved Yum-Yum “Were You Not to Ko-Ko Plighted”.<br>

            <p>I truly enjoyed the author's characterization of the MCs and the secondary
            characters, even more so due to the excellent vocalizations provided by the
            narrator. He was even spot-on with the voice of little Ollie!<br>

            <p>And, although it may have been due to the author's excellent ability to
            tell a story, I suspect that it was really due to the energy-driven
            narrative by Sean Lenhart.<br>
