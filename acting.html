            <p>Sean Lenhart also shines in the role of missionary preacher St. John Rivers,
            making this gentle and sweet but gradually possessive man the ultimate anti-Rochester.
            As the St. John Rivers era seems to be the end of the story, his gradual transition
            from savior to emotional manipulator literally made the audience gasp- his specific
            brand of imperialist fervor, combined with his belief that Jane is a gift from God
            to him, makes him only slightly less terrifying a cleric than Brocklehurst.<br>

            <p>Up in arms against the invading pirates are a group of policemen, played like a British version of the Keystone Cops. Sean Lenhart as the sergeant is the only one of the bobbies who doesn't succumb to the same level of buffoonery as his fellows. His persona is more constrained and sober. as a leader of men should be. It's a stance I found refreshing.<br>

            <p>Holy crap, those audible reviews don't do you justice at all… Honestly, I wouldn't have been able to listen to (author’s) book if someone else had been reading it. You made the neurotic thoughts seem natural and gave the characters personality.<br>

            stage director and choreographer Sean Lenhart does a capable job

            <p>I recall Lenhart killing it as the Prosecuting Attorney in Parade a while back and
            he did not disappoint this time around. Lenhart has quite a set of pipes on him and they
            were well exercised in songs such as “A Wandr’ing Minstrel I” or Nanki-Poo’s duet with
            his beloved Yum-Yum “Were You Not to Ko-Ko Plighted”.<br>

            <p>I truly enjoyed the author's characterization of the MCs and the secondary
            characters, even more so due to the excellent vocalizations provided by the
            narrator. He was even spot-on with the voice of little Ollie!<br>

            <p>And, although it may have been due to the author's excellent ability to
            tell a story, I suspect that it was really due to the energy-driven
