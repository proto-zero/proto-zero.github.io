            Chiropractic Care
          </div>
          <div class="text">
            Chiropractic is a health care profession that utilizes spinal and extremity adjusting (manipulation) aimed at improving the function of the spine, joints and nervous system. By improving the function, Chiropractic care aids the body in healing itself by promoting the body’s natural homeostasis.<br><br>

            Dr. Len and Dr. John Lenhart utilize several adjusting techniques including Grostic specific upper cervical, Cox, Gonstead and Thompson. Additionally, using the Arthrostim adjusting instrument, patients of all ages can receive Chiropractic care with a minimum of discomfort.<br><br>

            Lenhart Chiropractic Clinic also offers a variety of therapies to speed the recovery process. Therapies such as “soft laser” have been shown to enhance the body’s healing processes. The clinic also offers pain relieving therapies such as electrical stimulation modalities and therapeutic ultrasound.

            Meridian Therapy
          </div>
          <div class="text">
            Meridian therapy is the accepted name employed by those who practice the principle of acupuncture without the use of a penetrating needle. Dr. John Lenhart uses a “soft” laser instrument that combines the laser light with a microelectric stimulation of the acupuncture meridian points.<br><br>

            In his book, Personal Experience Points, Dr. John Amaro states that research has demonstrated that “stimulation by this means (laser) can be as much as two to three times more effective than needle stimulation.” Additionally, the laser stimulation eliminates the chance of infection. Because the skin is not punctured, meridian therapy can be performed on higher risk patients such as those with diminished immune response due to illness or chemotherapy. With no risk of bleeding, meridian therapy can be applied to those with bleeding problems such as patient’s taking medications such as Coumadin and Plavix.<br><br>

            <em>Note</em>: In Classic Acupuncture, needles are inserted into specific meridian points.<br>
            Meridian therapy applies high tech laser and micro electric stimulation to achieve an even greater response to stimulation of the identical points

            Rehabilitative Care
          </div>
          <div class="text">
            Rehabilitative exercise plays an integral role in health restoration. Lenhart Chiropractic Clinic offers rehabilitative therapy including flexibility, core stabilization and balance training/fall prevention all aimed at improving strength, coordination and endurance.<br><br>

            Unique to Lenhart Chiropractic Clinic is the hydrotherapy pool. Because water rehabilitation is performed in a non-weight bearing state, patients can begin the rehabilitative process much sooner than conventional exercise programs. The non-weight bearing exercise reduces the risk of exacerbating the patient’s injury. By working against water resistance early in the treatment process, there is reduced chance of muscle weakening due to inactivity.

            Upper Cervical
          </div>
          <div class="text">
            Upper cervical adjusting consists of light manipulation of the upper part of the neck. Since this is where the nervous system descends from the brain to the body, the effects of upper cervical adjusting can be very effective for a variety of conditions.<br><br>

            The adjusting is performed using an Arthrostim adjusting instrument. The Arthrostim achieves correction using a series of light thrusts.<br><br>
